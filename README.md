# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this customer-churn project, I have performed the visual analaysis as well as Machine Learning predictions that will tell weather a customer is continue to use services or else not.
In this project I have used different ML model and computed their accuracies using metrics so that we will come to know that which model is most suitable and which is least suitable here we will come to conclusion that Linear regression will be least suitable as the dataset has  binary output, so classification model will be used here. And whichever will give more accuracy will the most suitable model for the prediction purpose.
Some of the visualization techniques are also being used in this project for meaningful insights, also used boxplot for outliers detection purpose instead of writing a seprate function for detecting outliers in the columns.
After completing the implementation of the model we will able to understand which customers are not intrested to use the service, so that we can implement some measures to bring back the left customers.
The ML models I have used are: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
